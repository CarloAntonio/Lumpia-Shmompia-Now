# Lumpia-Shmompia-Now

## Udacity Android Nanodegree Project 6: Capstone
This is a fully functional and colorful application that I made for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program. This app allows a user to order Filipino food from the imaginary restuarant "Lumpia Shmompia." A grid displays menu items the restaurant would serve and allows the user to dive into the details for the food. Further, the user can add the food their "grocery basket" and submit their order.

### Features:
This app can:
* Display a grid of menu items
* Provide details for a particular item
* Give details, location, and direction to the imaginary restaurant
* "Order" filipino food

### How to work with the source code:
* This application uses [Google APIs](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862?hl=en) to serve ads and maps. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. After obtaining an API key, add to the "API_KEY" constant in the MainActivity.java file and the AndroidManifest.xml meta-data tags.
* This application uses [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) to serve weather coditions. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. After obtaining an API key, add to the apiKey field in the AboutActivity.java file.
